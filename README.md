In this course I learned all the basic fundamentals of Figma.
All from the most necessary and useful shortcuts to choosing colors, placement and simple wireframing.
Notes from the tutorial that I took can be viewed in my Notion page -> https://www.notion.so/Figma-125a24fa0a6180a58dadc9c868d1b425?pvs=4
